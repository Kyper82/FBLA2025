Time is of the Essence - A game by Kai Yang

Time is of the essence is a project I built to submit to FBLA for the Intro to Programming section. This is a text-based investment simulator game where players take on the role of an investor aiming to grow their wealth over time. The game involves making strategic decisions about investing in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and savings accounts while navigating market events like booms and recessions. The goal is to maximize your portfolio's value by the end of the game.
